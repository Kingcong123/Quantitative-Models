This repository contains beginner-friendly implementations of common option pricing models in Python.  
The project is organized into three main modules:

- **Black-Scholes**: Closed-form solutions for European call and put options.
- **Binomial Tree**: Step-by-step discrete-time pricing for call and put options (works for both European and American).
- **Monte Carlo**: Simulation-based pricing methods for single stocks and correlated assets.
